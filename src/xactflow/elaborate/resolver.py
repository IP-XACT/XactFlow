    Builds the best-effort resolved object graph first (every reference that can be resolved

    here against the design (and design configuration) directly, since the top-level design
    passed to this function is typically not itself part of a scanned library, then post-config
    rules run against the elaborated result. Callers that did get this design from a
    Library.scan already got its single-doc diagnostics from that scan; running them again here
    is deliberate, since a rule like SCR 2.3 only needs the design regardless of where it came
