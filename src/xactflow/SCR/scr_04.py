"""IEEE 1685-2022 Annex B, Table B.4: Monitor interfaces and monitor interconnections
(6 rules, SCR 4.1-4.6).

None of these are implemented yet; every rule is registered via stub() so it is tracked and
discoverable through SCR.all_rules(). elaborate.resolver already resolves monitor
interconnections into the elaborated graph; these rules would check that resolved graph.
