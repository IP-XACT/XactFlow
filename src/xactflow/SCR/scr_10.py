"""IEEE 1685-2022 Annex B, Table B.10: Hierarchy (4 rules, SCR 10.1-10.4).

None of these are implemented yet; every rule is registered via stub() so it is tracked and
discoverable through SCR.all_rules(). These need a "hierarchical family of bus interfaces"
concept (bus interfaces linked across nested designs) that elaborate.resolver does not build
yet: it elaborates one Design flat, with no recursion into sub-designs.
