"""IEEE 1685-2022 Annex B, Table B.11: Hierarchy and memory maps (4 rules, SCR 11.1-11.4).

None of these are implemented yet; every rule is registered via stub() so it is tracked and
discoverable through SCR.all_rules(). Same caveat as Table B.10: these need a hierarchical
family of bus interfaces concept elaborate.resolver does not build yet.
