    An exporter turns some IP-XACT-flavored Python object into an output artifact (RTL,
    documentation, another IP-XACT file, etc). `subject` is deliberately untyped: it may be an
    ElaboratedDesign, a bare ipxact.Component or ipxact.Design, or anything else a given exporter
    chooses to support. It is each exporter's own job to check what it was actually handed and
    document what it accepts.

    XactFlow itself ships no exporters; third-party packages register subclasses under the
    "xactflow.exporters" entry point group in their own pyproject.toml, and discover_exporters()
    below finds them without XactFlow depending on them.

    An exporter that itself generates IP-XACT output should re-run SCR checking on what it
    generated, using the public, standalone xactflow.SCR.run_single_doc_checks /
    run_post_config_checks functions.
